Ideally, research\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\n",

It can be a time-consuming and\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\ndocumented at all).
